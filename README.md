# Overview of projects

## MRI motion correction with MERLIN (python)
The MERLIN motion correction method, published in MRM in 2022 (link below), achieves motion correction using self navigation in 3D radial MRI. The method was developed using 3D radial ZTE. The source code used in the original paper is found in the [`pymerlin`](https://github.com/emilljungberg/pyMERLIN) repository. Code to reproduce the figures in the papers are found in [`merlin_mrm`](https://github.com/emilljungberg/merlin_mrm) repository.

From the paper [Ljungberg E,et al. Motion corrected silent ZTE neuroimaging. Magnetic Resonance in Med. 2022 Jul;88(1):195â€“210](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.29201)

## Data curation for Lund 7T MRI 
[`7T_BIDS_organiser`](https://github.com/SwedishNational7TMRI/7T_BIDS_organiser) is a framework for organising MRI data from the 7T system in Lund according to the BIDS format.
